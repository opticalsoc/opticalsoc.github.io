We are running a photo competition on the theme of 'Science at Home'. Whether it's your workspace, a home experiment setup, or an educational activity, we want to see some of the science you have been doing outside of the lab.

Feel free to interpret the brief in any way you like, as long as the photo relates to the theme of 'Science at Home'.
​

### How to enter the competition?

Send us your photo via twitter at @UofGOS and use #ScienceAtHomePosterCompetition in the tweet. If you do not have twitter, you can share the photo with us at uofgopticalsociety@gmail.com.
