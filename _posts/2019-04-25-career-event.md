14:00 - 17:00
(followed by drinks&snacks reception)
Common Room, Kelvin Building, University of Glasgow.

Not sure which step you should take after your PhD or postdoc?

Come and have a coffee with former optics PhD students, to explore some of your options!

Confirmed speakers:

- Robin Head from M Squared
- Sean Reilly from Coherent
- Adam McKenzie from CST Global
- Tony Boutle from Ocean Optics
- Daniele Faccio from Quantic
- Elizabeth Adams from UofG

The event will start with the speakers introducing themselves, telling us a bit about what they do now and how their career developed so far. Then, we will divide everybody into 6 groups and make each group spend some time with each of the speakers, for a rotating Q&A session accompanied by coffee and biscuits.

There is a limited number of spaces available, so please reserve your spot on Eventbrite!

We are all very excited about this event and the great panel of invited speakers, and hope you'll want to join us for this nice afternoon of career inspiration!
