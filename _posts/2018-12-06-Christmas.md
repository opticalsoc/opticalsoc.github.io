**Where:** Reading room (room 255), Kelvin Building (School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow);

**When:** Thursday 13th December 2018, from 6pm;


Christmas is around the corner and this is the perfect time for us to have our first official social event!

We dedicated a lot of energy in the last few months to setting up the society,  dealing with  ideas, technical meetings and a lot of bureaucracy. I think it's more than fair to say that we have done a great job so far, and the time has come for us all to celebrate!

Come to the reading room on Thursday, there will be cold snacks and lovely pizza and drinks:
we can all make a toast to the Optical Society, finally up and running, talk about ideas for the new year, have a look and play around with our new outreach kit, and most importantly spend some time all together :)

The event is open to members but also to anybody who is interested in knowing more about the Optical Society!

Hope to see many of you there,

Cheers,
